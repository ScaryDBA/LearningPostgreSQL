# LearningPostgre
Public access to the code created in a series of articles as I learn PostgreSQL.

The whole series is available at Simple-Talk, starting here:
https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/homepage/connecting-postgresql-learning-postgresql/

The early articles didn't follow a particular database, but most articles are based on the database in the CreateDatabase.sql file, so you can start there tocreate the HamShackRadio database.

Each folder corresponds to an article in the series. They're numbered in the same order as the series, hopefully making it easy to find the code you're looking for. Please reach out if you have questions or suggestions.
